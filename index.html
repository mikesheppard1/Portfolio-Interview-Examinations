  <p>Welcome to the code showcase.  My name is Mike Sheppard, I am currently a grade 12 student at A.Y Jackson.  I have been programming for less than a year.
    During that time, I have learned C++, java script, CSS and HTML.  Programming has allowed me to express myself and be creative.  
    Although I am a relatively new programmer, I will continue to program for years to come.</p>
    
    <h2> Heres a look at the top 10 programs that I coded this year </h2>
    
  <h3>Program 1</h3>
    
<p1>The first code that we will be looking at is my refactor of the summative.</p1>

<h3>Program 2</h3>
  <p2>The second program is the first project with moving objects in it</p2>
