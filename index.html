<h1>Code Showcase</h1>

  <p>Welcome to the code showcase.  My name is Mike Sheppard, I am currently a grade 12 student at A.Y Jackson.  I have been programming for less than a year.
    During that time, I have learned C++, java script, CSS and HTML.  Programming has allowed me to express myself and be creative.  
    Although I am a relatively new programmer, I can see myself programming for years to come.</p>
    
    <h2> Heres a look at the top 10 programs that I coded this year </h2>
    
  <h3>1: Summative Refactor</h3>

    <p1>The premiss of this code was to make your own creative version of an already created code.  
  This helped me learn as a student how to add my own creative touch on existing code.  
  It had me thinking and solving problems independently.  It helped me learn as a programmer as it forced me to create and fix 
  complex codes.  Not only that but I learned how to add objects, move them to random spots at the same time it takes for the 
  screen to refresh, and restrict them from going to certain places.   
</p1>
   

<h3>2: Shooting Star</h3>

    <p2>Although this was not a difficult project, this was my first time programming moving objects.  
    As a programmer, I learned how to move and orient objects in different directions by using for loops, functions, and objects.  
    As a student, it opened my eyes to what programming can be, it inspired me to keep programming because it taught me 
    that you can do whatever you want with programming. </p2>

    

<h3>3: CFuze</h3>

    <p3>Cfuze was the first coding project that I work on in a group.  As a student, I learned how to cooperate with other 
      people who had different ideas, I learned how to implement my own code, and most importantly, I learned how to come together 
      and brainstorm a brand new idea with a group.  That type of creativity is necessary in this day and age.  On the other hand, 
      as a programmer, I learned how to get RGB values from specific spots on the screen, and how to combine two RGB values together.  
      I will continue to come up with more creative ideas that can potentially help other people.</p3>    
                                                                                                                   

<h3>4: Fish Tank</h3>

<h3>5: Asteroids spaceship</h3>

<h3>6: Make it rain</h3>
    <img src = "https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/653269940912259075/672252183051501570/111.png">
    
    <p6>This project was the first time that I got to add objects each time I pressed the screen.  
      As a programmer, I can benefit from knowing this because if I were to make a video game where the user needs to interact 
      with the background, I would use this code.  This also expanded my knowledge of javascript, since this is a fundamental program that 
      I can build off of and make more complex code. </p6>
    

<h3>7: Recursive art</h3>
    
    <img src = "https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/653269940912259075/672237579126702100/Program_numero_Deaus.png">
    
    <p7>The “Recursive art” project taught me how algorithms and sequences work in code.  It helped me programming wise with the 
      summative because the code was based off of an algorithm.  Such as equations that focuses on each possible step after the 
      previous one it just took.  I can continue to use algorithms by implementing them into unordered lists, unordered numbers 
      going into order, and many more problems.</p7>

<h3>8: Blog</h3>
    
    <img src = "https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/653269940912259075/672240529400004640/2_Coolest_code_out_there.png">
    
    <p8>This project opened my eyes to what blogging is like.  After completing this project, I realized how easy it would be to make a blog template 
      that looks clean and professional.  Programming wise, I learned how to make headings, lists, and paragraphs.  I can see myself reusing 
      these techniques in the future if I ever need to make a blog, or even a website.  Personally, I learned you don't need to pay 
      ridiculous amounts of money to make a professional looking blog.</p8>

<h3>9: Build a Tribute Page</h3>

    <p9>Just like the blog project, the “Building a Tribute Page” project showed me how easy it is to make a professional looking 
      tribute/wikipedia page.  This expanded my knowledge of HTML as I learned how to add pictures, add links to text, and even change 
      the color of the background.  I can also use these techniques since they are crucial for a good looking webpage.  As a student, 
      I realized that anyone can make a webpage if they put their mind to it.</p9>

<h3>10: Bookshelf</h3>
